## Basic Concepts

### What is ThingsBoard?
ThingsBoard is an open-source IoT platform that enables:
- Device management
- Data collection
- Processing and visualization
- Device connectivity via industry standard IoT protocols
- Complex event processing and reactions using rule engine

### Key Components
- **Devices**: Physical or virtual entities that produce telemetry data
- **Assets**: Logical groups of devices
- **Customers**: Entities that own devices and assets
- **Dashboards**: Visualization interfaces for IoT data
- **Rule Engine**: Processing and reaction system for IoT data
