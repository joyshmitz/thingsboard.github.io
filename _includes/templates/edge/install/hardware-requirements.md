### Edge Hardware Requirements

The hardware specifications required for **ThingsBoard Edge** are determined by both the number of locally connected devices and the level of GUI interaction:

- **Light Usage:** If you intend to operate **ThingsBoard Edge** with minimal GUI interactions (such as local dashboards and device management) and expect to connect fewer than 100 devices to a single machine, at least 1GB of RAM should be sufficient.

- **Heavy Usage:** Conversely, for heavy GUI interactions and connections to 100+ devices on a single machine, we recommend allocating at least 4GB of RAM to ensure optimal performance.
